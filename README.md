Adaptive Categorization for Efficient storage management system This is based on Neural Network which can takes uncertain input, categorizes and stores input according to the need of the user into LTM and STM finally finally adapting to the need and ccategorizing it.
The Algorithm used are

  Feedforward neural network with Bayesian layers (or Dropout) for uncertainty estimation and to provide confidence scores for predictions.
  Predictions with low confidence are flagged for further evaluation or model retraining.
  Adapts dynamically using Reinforcement Learning to improve predictions over time.
  Implements migration policies using categorization results. STAGE 1
